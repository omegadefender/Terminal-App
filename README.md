## What is Hearthstone, and what is Hearthstone Arena?

Hearthstone is a popular online card game made by Blizzard Entertainment. It based on the Warcraft universe that other popular games (like WOW) are set in.

Hearthstone is like cricket, in that there are different formats of the game, Constructed, Arena, Tavern Brawl, and Solo. Gemstone focuses on assisting players with the Arena format.

The Arena format of Hearthstone allows players to spend real currency, or in-game currency, to buy a ticket to compete in Arena.

The rules of Arena are as follows. Player chooses what character (class) they play, and then they need to create a deck of 30 cards. Adding a card to the deck requires the player to choose from three randomly presented cards.

Once a player has filled up their deck, they then play games of Hearthstone with other Arena entrants. Players get knocked out of the Arena "run" when they lose 3 games, or win 12. The more wins a player gets, the bigger the prize in in-game currency, and HS cards.

If a player is skilled enough they can go "infinite" in Arena which means that they don't have to spend real money on the game.

## Drafting an Arena Deck with Gemstone

The stronger your Arena deck, the better your chances of getting as many wins as possible.

Some cards are better than others, but as there are so many cards in the game, it can be hard to make a wise choice. Gemstone makes that choice easier, by providing the player with data sourced from the best Arena card ranking sites, Lightforge and Hearth Arena.

You need to download the soure code from [Gituhub](https://github.com/lukestainlay/ProjectGemstone "Link to Github"), and run the program via your terminal.

Open gemstone.rb in terminal. You will be asked to choose the class from menu. Then you you be asked to enter the cards for each choice

Once you have choosen you HS class, you can type in the names of the cards that HS is offering you. Gemstone will retrieve the LF and HA scores for that card. Repeat until you have the scores for all three cards. Then you can make your choice in the HS app itself.
